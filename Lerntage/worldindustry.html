        <p>More than half of the experts surveyed see the US president as a threat to the global economy. The worst effects are in the areas of social justice and environmental protection. But also in international trade, cooperation in multilateral organizations
          and the key issues of peace and security. You probably wonder why, just because of natural disasters like typhoons, floods and drought. These natural disasters make many industrial products a scarce commodity. As these products become scarce,
          prices rise and end users must pay more. There is also a next problem, such as the problem of the poorer countries, because they cannot afford it. On the topic of stagnation of operation there was an earthquake in April 2016 Japan hit and damaged
          plants that sold parts to Toyota and forced the car giant to stop production. Even the health industry could be affected. The warmer weather not only affects the availability of clean water and food, but also increases the vulnerability of areas
          already threatened by diseases such as malaria and dengue. The recent Zika epidemic may have been exacerbated by warmer weather conditions. The World Health Organization predicts between 2030 and 2050 that climate change will cause around 250,000
          additional deaths each year. Add to this the heat stress in the forestry and agriculture, the building fabric or the textile industry, production losses: the warmer it is, the faster the workers are exhausted and the less efficient they can
          work. This connection is linear. With every additional degree, productivity drops. The researchers used their computer model to study the period from 1991 to 2011. They examined the economic relations between 186 countries and 26 industrial
          sectors. In the early years, heat stress losses had little impact on other parts of the world. From the year 2000, however, the model showed ever greater consequences for the rest of the world. According to Leonie Wenz, this is due to global
          supply relationships, which have increased massively since the beginning of the 21st century. Under normal circumstances, this globalization increases the efficiency of the economy. In times of climate change, they also increase the risks. It
          shows for the first time that not only the actual warming of the planet plays a role, but also the nature or resilience of society and the economic system in which the damage occurs. Thus, the susceptibility of the global economy to heat stress
          has doubled in the last decade. For example, many countries today rely more on raw materials from India than in 1991. A heat wave is also affecting the production chains in far-flung Alaska. There is also a problem like the problem of the poorer
          countries, because they cannot afford it. From this information we can see that climate change has a huge impact on the global economy. But there is a solution for every problem. For these there may be several, how to use the energy source,
          in which no propellant gases are released, also the land use must be changed, to reduce the release of greenhouse gases.</p>
