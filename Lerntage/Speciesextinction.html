<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-US">Global
warming is a big point in today’s world. But if you think of the consequences,
most people are going to think of the melting ice masses or destroyed
landscapes. The problems many different kinds of animals have to deal with
because of this are often just seen at the second sight. If the temperature is still
going to climb some degree, there are going to be fatal consequences for some
sorts of animals, because they can’t fit to the climate conditions anymore. And
apart from that their natural habitats are getting smaller and fragmented, in
some parts even destroyed. For example the rainforests aren’t as big as they once
were because of less humidity caused by the global warming. In history the
nature had to change some times before, but the climate change moves on much
faster than a natural change would. Therefore the animals can’t fit fast enough
to the new conditions and will maybe die out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-US">However, the
Trump administration has declined to list 25 animals for protection ignoring
scientific facts that they are endangered. For example the Pacific walrus,
Barbour’s map turtle, the black-backed woodpecker and other animals will not be
put under protection. Under the Obama administration the Department of the
Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) argued that especially the Pacific
walrus was threatened by climate change. But under the administration of
President Trump the FWS says that climate models beyond 2060 are not exact
enough to tell how much the ice-based habitat of the walrus will melt. Anyway
there may be no more ice at all in 2060 an the walrus will lose its living
environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-US">The global
warming can provoke a species extinction from nine to fifty-two percent only
until the middle of this century. How many kinds of animals are going to die
out at last, depends on how much global warming gases are set free in the
atmosphere until then. The most famous example for endangered animals is the
polar bear, whose living space literally melts away. But next to that there are
many other animals: the mountain hare, who lives in the high mountains, can
just go limited round the rising temperatures. The food and safehouses aren’t
enough for them anymore. Besides it was found out that if the temperatures are
too high in the winter there will be rain instead of snow. The rain will cause
frost which will cover the food of some mammals like bats or reindeers. The
animals won’t find enough aliment and will starve. When an animal species becomes
extinct another problem will arise: every species has its special place in the
ecosystem of the earth. So if for example the mountain hare is lost, the eagle
owl, the fox and the golden eagle will shed an important prey animal. Or as
probably many people may know, insects are very important, too. But the climate
change doesn’t make life easier for them. It may not look so important, if just
one species is dead, but in the end the complete ecosystem will get out of
balance and other animals will have trouble with searching food.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-US">For saving
the animals it’s important to have a view on how much global warming gases are
pegged into the atmosphere and to have strict rules how much can be discharged
by every country. This is regulated in the Paris Climate Agreement, but if the
USA aren’t part of it anymore, they aren’t bound to those rules any longer – at
least not seen politically. For the natural aspect it would be very good if
they would try to decrease the global warming gases. The USA aren’t a small
part of the world so if they would produce far too much global warming gases
the species extinction would go on much faster. At the moment the effects can’t
be seen clearly in many parts of the world, if you don’t employ yourself
intensive with this topic. That’s probably the reason why President Donald
Trump doesn’t believe in it. For example he once wrote on Twitter: “It’s
freezing outside, where the hell is “global warming”?” But the first precursors
for the global warming are already here. For example some migratory birds are
coming back early from the south. Some kinds of them, like the crane, don’t
even go away anymore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-US">It was also
found out that if the temperature is going to rise just one centigrade, some
animal species of the tropical forests are going to die out and the corals are
going to bleach out. If the temperature is going to climb two centigrade the
coral bleach is going to be unchangeable. Further, fifteen to thirty-seven
percent of all species are condemned to die out. If the temperature rises three
centigrade this will concern twenty to fifty percent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-US">But not
just the animals suffer under the global warming. The American economy is going
to have some problems, too.</span></p>
