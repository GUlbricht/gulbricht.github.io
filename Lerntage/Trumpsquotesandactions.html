      <p>Over the years, Donald Trump has said many controversial things about global warming. Especially on Twitter, he wrote a lot about it. For example, with things like <i>“it’s freezing outside, where the hell is `global warming´?”</i>, <i>“it’s really cold outside,
        they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming!”</i> and <i>“Ice storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee – I’m in Los Angeles and it’s freezing. Global warming is a total, and very expensive,
        [joke]!”</i>, he made it sound like he only needs global warming to have warmer weather and doesn’t care about the other consequences of global warming like a higher water level.</p><p>Additionally, he thinks that people are lying about it in
        order to earn more money (<i>“It’s a scam for a lot of people to make a lot of money”</i>) or <i>“[…] in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”</i> and that they are <i>“[…] wasting money on global warming and so many other truly “STUPID” things […]”</i>.
        Plus, he doesn’t believe in climate change, he thinks that how the weather works (<i>“It’ll get cooler, it’ll get warmer, it’s called weather”</i>) There’s a difference between weather and climate, you can’t say there’s no change because at one
        week it’s different. Weather is for one day/week, climate is for a long period of time. There’s no contradiction between a cold snap and global warming.<br>
        <br> On the 1st of June 2017 his words were followed by actions. On this day he withdrew from the Paris agreement 2017, making the USA to the only country worldwide to not be in it.</p><p>The Paris climate agreement tries to keep the temperature
        change under 2° Celsius, in the best case under 1.5° Celsius, tries to find a possibility to better the negative thing of a climate change like a higher water level or dying animal species and has regulation how many greenhouse gas is allowed
        to get in the air.</p><p>In his speech about the withdrawal, President Trump said, <i>“The Paris accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States”</i> and that it would cost $3 trillion and 6.5 million jobs. Additionally, he told
        the press that the US won’t do any pledges made in Paris including payments.</p><p>This decision was criticized by many other politician, inside the USA and outside.</p><p>Furthermore Donald Trump supports and wants to renew the US coal industry
        which would cause several billion more greenhouse gas. One typical coal power plat release as much greenhouse gas as 600,000 cars. This would raise the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which would make it even more difficult to keep the global
        warming under 2°C. Plus is the coal industry a dying industry because there are strict rules about the greenhouse gas output and their energy isn’t needed.</p><p><br><br>Sadly, his actions are affecting not only the UAS, but the whole entire world.
