change is influencing deep sea<br>
The ice melting in the arctic can lead to lack of oxygen. <br>
Bremerhaven. If in summer a big quantity of arctic sea ice will melt, it can
lead to lack of oxygen. Responsible for that are the alga’s, which are growing
on the backside of the ice. If it melts, so the alga’s are sank on the ground.
That referred researcher under the management, from the
Alfred-Wegener-Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven at the trade journal “science”.
Sea cucumbers and other animals of the sea eats a big part of the alga’s. The
bacterium decomposed the remains and take the oxygen on the ground off. In the
darkness the animals can’t produce oxygen. <br>
<br>
One international team around Antje Boetius from AWI was 2012 with the research
ship “Polarstern” through the central arctic, in order to examine, how the
ecosystem changed the global warming. This is going “much faster as notional”
says Boetius. Up to 10% of the sea ground in a deep of 4000 meters are covered
with up to 50 cm with alga cluster.<br>
<br>
As first experts scale the oxygen concentration at the ground. The Bacterium
began to decompose the alga’s and decrease the oxygen. The sea ground in the
neighboring area of 80 cm is aired and haven’t got vegetable remains. Where the
algae are consumed, the aired area is contract to a few millimeters. Normally
the dead algae sank slowly to the ground and on the way, they are eaten from
other animals. Large algae chains on the ice backside clump and sank fast on
the ground, if the ice floe melts. <br>
<br>
The climate change strikes double, said Boetius: “The warming of the arctic
lead to a drop of the ice thickener, and so the algae on the backside of the
ice have lighter to grow. We can at first show, that the warming and the
connected physical changing in the arctic fast reactions on the total ecosystem
till the deep-sea evocation.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><a href="https://www.abendblatt.de/ratgeber/wissen/article113650577/Klimawandel-beeinflusst-Tiefsee.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;" lang="EN-GB">https://www.abendblatt.de/ratgeber/wissen/article113650577/Klimawandel-beeinflusst-Tiefsee.html</span></a></span></p><p></p><p>

In one study warn US-public&nbsp;authorities of the climate change and answers
with it the president. Scientists doubt, that the government publish the results.<br>
One coal power station near the Rock Springs in Wyoming (picture). <br>
In one common article for the US-government, scientists and researcher arrive
from 13 public authorities under New York Times (NYT) to the result, that the
USA already concerned of the consequents from the climate change. <br>
Still the study isn’t published yet, they can come the politician: In the
report, some researcher is afraid of that the results could be changed from
Donald Trump. <br>
“All people are very stressed”, cited the NYT Michael Oppenheimer, Prof of
earth sciences at the university in Princeton. “It is the first time, that such
an extensive study be a subject about the climate change is such a big deal for
the Trump-government. The researcher didn’t look so good, how Trump reacts.”
said Oppenheimer, who isn’t involved to this study. <br>
<br>
The originator of the survey is the National Science Academy of the USA. The
study contradicts the testimony of Trump and some of his ministers that the
human impact on climate change is uncertain and the effects are unpredictable.
For example, Scott Pruitt, Head of the National Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), had to officially approve the report, as did 12 other government
agencies. He does not believe that carbon dioxide is directly responsible for
global warming, Pruitt had said. According to the NYT, the EPO has overseen,
blocked or postponed more than 30 environmental regulations in recent months.<br>
<br>
Trump had announced in early June, the US exit from the Paris Agreement on
climate change and said that his country would not implement the agreement
"immediately". For the US president, the deal was "a bad
deal", an important tool for climate change activists to mitigate the
effects of global warming. These are also drastic for the US, according to the
government's climate report. "The Americans are already feeling the
effects of climate change," the New York Times quotes from the report.
According to this, the average temperature in the USA has risen "rapidly
and drastically" since 1980 and the past decades have been the hottest in
1,500 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
