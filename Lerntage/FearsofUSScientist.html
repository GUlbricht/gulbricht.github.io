        <p>US-Scientist fears control to climate report<br> In one study warn US-public&nbsp;authorities of the climate change and answers with it the president. Scientists doubt, that the government publish the results.<br> One coal power station near the
          Rock Springs in Wyoming (picture). <br> In one common article for the US-government, scientists and researcher arrive from 13 public authorities under New York Times (NYT) to the result, that the USA already concerned of the consequents from
          the climate change. <br> Still the study isn’t published yet, they can come the politician: In the report, some researcher is afraid of that the results could be changed from Donald Trump. <br> <i>“All people are very stressed”</i>, cited the
          NYT Michael Oppenheimer, Prof of earth sciences at the university in Princeton. <i>“It is the first time, that such an extensive study be a subject about the climate change is such a big deal for the Trump-government. The researcher didn’t look so good, how
          Trump reacts.”</i> said Oppenheimer, who isn’t involved to this study. <br>
          <br> The originator of the survey is the National Science Academy of the USA. The study contradicts the testimony of Trump and some of his ministers that the human impact on climate change is uncertain and the effects are unpredictable. For
          example, Scott Pruitt, Head of the National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), had to officially approve the report, as did 12 other government agencies. He does not believe that carbon dioxide is directly responsible for global warming,
          Pruitt had said. According to the NYT, the EPO has overseen, blocked or postponed more than 30 environmental regulations in recent months.<br>
          <br> Trump had announced in early June, the US exit from the Paris Agreement on climate change and said that his country would not implement the agreement "immediately". For the US president, the deal was "a bad deal", an important tool for
          climate change activists to mitigate the effects of global warming. These are also drastic for the US, according to the government's climate report. <i>"The Americans are already feeling the effects of climate change,"</i> the New York Times
          quotes from the report. According to this, the average temperature in the USA has risen "rapidly and drastically" since 1980 and the past decades have been the hottest in 1,500 years.</p>
