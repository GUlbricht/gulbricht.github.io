        <p>The sea-level rise every ten years about 3,2 centimeters. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) said in his fifth climate-report, that the sea-level could rise (by undamped global warming gases) about 52 to 98 centimeters till the
          year 2100. “The sea level is rising faster than expected, and the increase has accelerated.” These are three of the key messages of the new IPCC report. And in very much years, in 2300, it could be three meters high, because the deep-sea expand
          by reason of the climate change. The report doesn’t respect the melted continental-ice, because this is not possible with today's computer models. In March 2006, the science journal “Science” published a study which said, that the rising could
          take more meters than expected. Some other glacier-researcher are afraid, that the mainland ice could melt much faster than previously thought.
          <br> Since 1870, the global sea-level has risen by about 20 cm. In contrast, a rate of increase over the last hundred years would mean an increase of almost four meters over 2000 years. The sea-level rise observed now is certainly a modern phenomenon
          that began between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The sea-level rise is a physical consequence of warming, for two reasons. First, the volume of seawater increases as it warms, as water expands when heated. And second, the amount of
          water in the ocean is increasing overall, mainly to the melting of the ice masses on land.<br> And the biggest problem is, that if all the ice of Greenland, of the Arctic and of the Antarctic melt, the sea-level will rise until dangerous 78
          meters.
          <br> The ever-rising sea-level could flood much coastal areas and cities. In coastal areas and coastal cities lived the most people of the world. 22 of the 50 largest cities in the world are coastal cities. For example: Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong
          Kong, New York, Mumbai. About 10 percent of the world's population live near the coast on areas less than 10 meters above sea-level. For example, in Bangladesh, 17 percent of the country's surface is not even more than one meter above sea level
          - on this area live 35 million people. And Bangladesh is so poor that it cannot protect itself. The low-lying Netherlands is already building a super dike to protect itself against the climate-change. But Bangladesh will not be able to build
          something like that, because it’s too poor. The countries, which lie in the Pacific on coral reefs, for example the Maldives, could disappear completely: the coral reefs will be destroy; the sea level will rise, and storms will be stronger –
          that would be the end of these beautiful countries. But they going to help itself. For example, the pacific-islands Kiribati and Tuvalu have requested immigration-rights for their citizens in Australia and New Zealand.)<br><br> The sea-level
          rise will be different on different coasts. Firstly, absolute differences in sea-level are not the same everywhere, because regionally differentiated warming, linked to change in ocean currents, influences the slope of the sea surface. Second,
          the land also rises or falls on some coasts. On the German coasts, both effects will contribute to the sea-level rising more than the global average.<br><br> A comparison between temperature and the sea-level in recent geological history suggests
          that the rise until the year 2100 is just a start of a long-term rise.</p>
        <p>
          But the warming of the ocean could have even more dramatic consequences for our world. Specials for our wild animals.
