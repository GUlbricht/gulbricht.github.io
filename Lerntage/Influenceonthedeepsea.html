        <p>Climate change is influencing deep sea<br> The ice melting in the arctic can lead to lack of oxygen. <br> Bremerhaven. If in summer a big quantity of arctic sea ice will melt, it can lead to lack of oxygen. Responsible for that are the alga’s,
          which are growing on the backside of the ice. If it melts, so the alga’s are sank on the ground. That referred researcher under the management, from the Alfred-Wegener-Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven at the trade journal “science”. Sea cucumbers
          and other animals of the sea eats a big part of the alga’s. The bacterium decomposed the remains and take the oxygen on the ground off. In the darkness the animals can’t produce oxygen.</p>
        <p>One international team around Antje Boetius from AWI was 2012 with the research ship “Polarstern” through the central arctic, in order to examine, how the ecosystem changed the global warming. This is going “much faster as notional” says Boetius.
          Up to 10% of the sea ground in a deep of 4000 meters are covered with up to 50 cm with alga cluster.</p>
        <p>As first experts scale the oxygen concentration at the ground. The Bacterium began to decompose the alga’s and decrease the oxygen. The sea ground in the neighboring area of 80 cm is aired and haven’t got vegetable remains. Where the algae are
          consumed, the aired area is contract to a few millimeters. Normally the dead algae sank slowly to the ground and on the way, they are eaten from other animals. Large algae chains on the ice backside clump and sank fast on the ground, if the
          ice floe melts.</p>
        <p>The climate change strikes double, said Boetius: “The warming of the arctic lead to a drop of the ice thickener, and so the algae on the backside of the ice have lighter to grow. We can at first show, that the warming and the connected physical
          changing in the arctic fast reactions on the total ecosystem till the deep-sea evocation.”</p>
